==LEGAL DISCLAIMER==

This is a modified version of the original Yedda.Twitter C# wrapper/library.
I have added it here as part of my working respository as a continous 
work-in-progress, but currently I am unsure of my right to distribute the
final source code or binary assembly.

Use of this modified library is currenty NOT recommended until
I contact the original author, Eran Sandler for formal permission 
to redistribute it.

Thanks.
