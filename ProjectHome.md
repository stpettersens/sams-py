## This Project ##

This project features a collection of small applications and general use modules that I either have completed or am working on. I have decided to host them all here rather than give each their own project. Larger projects will get their own project.

Originally, this project was intended for just Python based-projects (hence the name _sams-py_), but it has since expanded to include other code in C# and Boo. The code base will continue to diversify.

_Implemented in Python_,
_Targeting: Windows and Unix-like desktop platforms_

Txtrevise is a command line text editing tool, designed for quickly replacing text on a specific line in a chosen file. It is a much neater rewrite of a tool that I previously wrote in C++, called [revise](http://revise.codeplex.com).

### Nitwit: Twitter client library ###


_Not yet released - WIP_,
_Implemented in C#_,
_Targeting: CLR(.NET/Mono) applications_

Nitwit (_dotNet implemented twitter_) is a .NET library which allows CLR applications to interact with [Twitter](http://twitter.com). It provides quick and easy access to Twitter's REST and Search APIs.
Nitwit was created after I had made numerous alterations to the [Yedda.Twitter library](http://is.gd/N4Nz) and its design was inspired by it.
