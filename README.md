## This Project
This project features a collection of small applications and general use modules that I either have completed or am working on. I have decided to host them all here rather than give each their own project. Larger projects will get their own project.

Originally, this project was intended for just Python based-projects (hence the name sams-py), but it has since expanded to include other code in C# and Boo. The code base will continue to diversify.

## Txtrevise text editing tool

Txtrevise is a command line text editing tool, designed for quickly replacing text on a specific line in a chosen file. It is a much neater rewrite of a tool that I previously wrote in C++, called revise.

## Nitwit: Twitter client library
Not yet released - WIP, Implemented in C#, Targeting: CLR(.NET/Mono) applications

Nitwit (dotNet implemented twitter) is a .NET library which allows CLR applications to interact with Twitter. It provides quick and easy access to Twitter's REST and Search APIs. Nitwit was created after I had made numerous alterations to the Yedda.Twitter library and its design was inspired by it.
